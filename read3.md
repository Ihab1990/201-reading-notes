# HTML lists


There are three types of * HTML * lists:
1- ordered
2- unordered 
3- definition.
X Ordered lists use numbers.
X Unordered lists use bullets.
X Definition lists are used to define terminology.
X Lists can be nested inside one another.

## You can put a second list inside
an <li> element to create a sublist or nested list.

'The definition list is created with
the <dl> element and usually
consists of a series of terms and
their definitions.
Inside the <dl> element you will
usually see pairs of <dt> and
<dd> elements.'

** CSS treats each HTML element as if it has its own box.
X You can use CSS to control the dimensions of a box.
X You can also control the borders, margin and padding
for each box with CSS.
X It is possible to hide elements using the display and
visibility properties.
X Block-level boxes can be made into inline boxes, and
inline boxes made into block-level boxes.
X Legibility can be improved by controlling the width of
boxes containing text and the leading.
X CSS3 has introduced the ability to create image
borders and rounded borders. **

# Java 

-- An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't
just store one value; it stores a list of values.--

if ... e 1 se statement allows you
to provide two sets of code:
1. one set if the condition
evaluates to true
2. another set if the condition is
false  

------


string = Text
number = Number
Boolean = true or false
null = Empty value
undefined =  Variable has been declared but not yet assigned a value

False values can also be treated
as the number 0 .
Truth values are treated as if
they are true. Almost everything
that is not in the false table can
be treated as if it were true.
Truth values can also be treated
as the number 1.


A for loop is often used to loop
through the items in an array. 

Comparison operators (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>)
are used to compare two operands. 

There are three types of loop: for, while, and
do ... while. Each repeats a set of statements
