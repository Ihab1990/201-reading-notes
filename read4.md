# Links


### Links are created using the <a> element.
X The <a> element uses the href attribute to indicate
the page you are linking to.
X If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is
best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs.
X You can create links to open email programs with an
email address in the "to" field.
X You can use the id attribute to target elements within
a page that can be linked to.



### If you want a link to open in a
new window, you can use the
target attribute on the opening
<a> tag. The value of this
attribute should be _blank.


### To create a link that starts up
the user's email program and
addresses an email to a specified
email address, you use the <a>
element. However, this time the
value of the href attribute starts
with mailto: and is followed by
the email address you want the
email to be sent to.

### Relative URLs can be used when linking to pages within your own
website. They provide a shorthand way of telling the browser where to
find your files.


# LAYOUT
### X <div> elements are often used as containing elements
to group together sections of a page.
X Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you
specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.
X The float property moves content to the left or right
of the page and can be used to create multi-column
layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)
X Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.
X Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide,
and indicate what the site is about within the top 600
pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).
X Grids help create professional and flexible designs.
X CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.
X You can include multiple CSS files in one page.

# JS
### Browsers require very detailed instructions about what
we want them to do. Therefore, complex scripts can run
to hundreds (even thousands) of lines. Programmers use
functions, methods, and objects to organize their code.

Functions allow you to group a set of related
statements together that represent a single task.
Functions can take parameters (informatiorJ required
to do their job) and may return a value.
An object is a series of variables and functions that
represent something from the world around you.
In an object, variables are known as properties of the
object; functions are known as methods of the object.
