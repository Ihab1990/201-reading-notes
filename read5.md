## The <img> element 
 is used to add images to a
web page.
X You must always specify a src attribute to indicate the
source of an image and an alt attribute to describe the
content of an image.
X You should save images at the size you will be using
them on the web page and in the appropriate format.
X Photographs are best saved as JPEGs; illustrations or
logos that use flat colors are better saved as GIFs.
<br />
The <figcaption> element has
been added to HTML5 in order
to allow web page authors to add
a caption to an image.
Before these elements were
created there was no way to
associate an <img> element with
its caption
<br />

Images often come with
captions. HTML5 has introduced
a new <figure> element to
contain images and their caption
so that the two are associated.
You can have more than one
image inside the <figure>
element as long as they all share
the same caption.

## Color 
not only brings your site to life, but also helps
convey the mood and evokes reactions.
X There are three ways to specify colors in CSS:
RGB values, hex codes, and color names.
X Color pickers can help you find the color you want.
X It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast
between any text and the background color (otherwise
people will not be able to read your content).
X CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to
indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.
X CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values,
with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.

## Text
There are properties to control the choice of font, size,
weight, style, and spacing.
X There is a limited choice of fonts that you can assume
most people will have installed.
X If you want to use a wider range of typefaces there are
several options, but you need to have the right license
to use them.
X You can control the space between lines of text,
individual letters, and words. Text can also be aligned
to the left, right, center, or justified. It can also be
indented.
X You can use pseudo-classes to change the style of an
element when a user hovers over or clicks on text, or
when they have visited a link.
